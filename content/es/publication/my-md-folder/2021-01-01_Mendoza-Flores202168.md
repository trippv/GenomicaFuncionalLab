abstract = "Paralytic shellfish toxin (PST) content in the dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum changes with culture age, with a higher toxin concentration in the logarithmic phase that decreases when the culture ages. The gene copy number (GCN) of domains sxtA1 and sxtA4 was higher in the lag and stationary phase, and lag phase, respectively. No relationship was found between the GCN of the domains sxtA4 and sxtA1 with the PST content in G. catenatum. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd"
