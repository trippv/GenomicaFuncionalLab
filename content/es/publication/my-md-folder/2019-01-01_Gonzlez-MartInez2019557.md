abstract = "An obligate halophile fungal was isolated from 275 m deep marine sediments and is characterized here for the first time. Its optimal growth was at 15% NaCl even though it was able to grow at 25% and is incapable of growth with no NaCl. Based on its morphological characteristics as conidia chain production in a single phialide, the fungal is related to the genus Aspergillus, subgenus Polypaecilum. Phylogenetic molecular analysis using several markers (ITS1–2; RPB1; RPB2; Cct8; TSR1; CaM; BenA) places the fungal isolate closer to Aspergillus salinarus and A. baarnensis. However, its morphological and molecular differences establish it as a new species, Aspergillus loretoensis sp. nov. © 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature."
