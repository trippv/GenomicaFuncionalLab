  abstract = {Microsatellite loci were isolated in Haliotis fulgens using a (CT) n enriched-genomic library. From 33 sequenced clones, 21 microsatellites regions were identified, 15 with the expected (CT)n. Eight microsatellite loci were amplified, six of which were polymorphic with a range of three to 20 alleles, and five cross-amplified in two other species (Haliotis rufescens and Haliotis corrugata). These microsatellites will be useful as population genetic markers in the three species. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},
