abstract={Larval genetic information influences populations’ genetic pools, causing genetic homogenization or structuration. So, knowing about adult and larval genetic information is essential to understand processes such as connectivity. The aims are to evaluate Twospot flounder (Bothus robinsi, a fish with a high dispersal potential) larval pools’ genetic diversity, test if the larvae tend to mix or display collective dispersal, compare genetic information between larvae and adults and evaluate its connectivity. We used ddRADSEQ to genotype 1,034 single nucleotide polymorphic sites from B. robinsi larvae sampled in waters from the Bay of Campeche and the eastern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) and adults sampled on Florida’s continental shelf. Larvae were identified morphologically and by DNA barcoding. We estimated Fst-paired comparations, Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Discriminant Analyses of Principal Components (DAPC), and a Structure analysis to understand genetic trends. With the software COLONY, we made a sibship evaluation. We observed no significant heterogeneity among regions (Fst p-values>0.05). PCA, DAPC, and the Structure Analysis showed one genetic cluster, indicating genetic homogeneity. We did not detect full-sibs or half-sibs. We linked the results with the high dispersal potential of B. robinsi due to a long pelagic larval duration and the potential of ocean dynamics to transport and mix larvae from all GOM shelf areas. These findings suggest that the dispersal potential of B. robinsi is large enough to produce genetic connectivity in all GOM subpopulations and that time spent by its larvae in dispersal pathways is enough to mix larvae from different GOM subpopulations, indicating a panmictic population.

abstract={The evaluation of biodiversity is a primary concern for natural sciences and society, including marine ecosystems. Zooplankton plays a crucial role in marine ecosystems, transferring energy between trophic levels and participating in carbon and nutrient cycling. Zooplankton communities respond to changes in environmental conditions in complex ways and are highly susceptible to anthropogenic impacts, including climate change. However, the study of their diversity relative to environmental conditions has been hindered by their extremely high taxonomic diversity, which requires a high level of specialization for the morphological identification of specific taxa. We used metabarcoding to evaluate the relationship between zooplankton diversity and oceanic conditions along two transects in the Perdido region of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico during the summer and fall of 2016. This area has active oil production and ongoing exploratory wells. We focused on five zooplankton groups: Mollusca, Calanoida, Non-Calanoid copepods, Decapoda, and Amphipoda. We found that the studied groups had different levels of diversity that varied among sampling stations and seasons, and the taxonomic composition had larger differences among stations than between seasons. We found that environmental variables may have influenced the presence of zooplanktonic groups; however, we conclude that it is not possible to generalize deterministic factors that influence zooplankton diversity and that both the spatial and temporal scales are needed to take into account to determine the factors that shape such diversity. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={The genus Bothus includes small flatfishes classified as left-eyed flounders. Within the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), B. ocellatus and B. robinsi are the most widely distributed species, whose differentiation using morphological characters has been a challenge limiting their accurate identification. Larvae were sampled during two summer seasons (2015 and 2017) in the GoM. Morphological characters allowing identification of both larval species were limited, so they were classified as Bothus spp. Two morphotypes were observed based on the melanophore’s presence on the tip of the caudal fin. Species identification was made using a portion of the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene. COI sequences for 126 larvae were identified using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) searches of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank and the Barcode of Life Data (BOLD) System repositories. COI sequences for larvae and reference sequences from databases were used to build phylogenetic trees and perform genetic distance analyses. COI analyses identified 21 larvae as B. ocellatus and 105 as B. robinsi. Both morphotypes were detected in both species and no diagnostic characteristics were observed. The geographic distribution of the species was similar, but B. robinsi abundance was higher than B. ocellatus in contrast to findings of previous studies. These differences between the results in this study and those of previous ones could have been due to errors in identifications based solely on morphological characters. Therefore, the results obtained demonstrate the power of molecular approaches to improve accuracy of the information generated for Bothus genus larvae. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Hippocampus erectus inhabiting the shallow coastal waters of the southern Gulf of Mexico are naturally exposed to marked temperature variations occurring in different temporal scales. Under such heterogeneous conditions, a series of physiological and biochemical adjustments take place to restore and maintain homeostasis. This study investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in the response of H. erectus to increased temperature using transcriptome analysis based on RNA-Seq technology. Data was obtained from seahorses after 0.5-h exposure to combinations of different target temperatures (26 °C: control, and increased to 30 and 33 °C) and rates of thermal increase (abrupt: < 5 min; gradual: 1–1.5 °C every 3 h). The transcriptome of seahorses was assembled de novo using Trinity software to obtain 29,211 genes and 30,479 transcripts comprising 27,520,965 assembled bases. Seahorse exposure to both 30 and 33 °C triggered characteristic processes of the cellular stress response, regardless of the rate of thermal change. The transcriptomic profiles of H. erectus suggest an arrest of muscle development processes, the activation of heat shock proteins, and a switch to anaerobic metabolism within the first 0.5 h of exposure to target temperatures to ensure energy supply. Interestingly, apoptotic processes involving caspase were activated principally in gradual treatments, suggesting that prolonged exposure to even sublethal temperatures results in the accumulation of deleterious effects that may eventually terminate in cellular death. Results herein validate 30 °C and 33 °C as potential upper limits of thermal tolerance for H. erectus at the southernmost boundary of its geographic distribution. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The octopus optic glands are the source of multiple signalling molecules that control the transitions through different physiological stages, such as maturation, ageing and death. This study focused on the role of the optic glands during the reproductive phase of Octopus maya, investigating the molecular mechanisms that prevent reproduction at elevated temperatures. RNA sequencing was used to analyse and compare optic gland transcriptomic profiles of female O. maya before, during and after egg-laying under optimal and thermal stress (elevated temperature) conditions. Each stage showed well-defined transcriptomic patterns, and all were strongly affected by thermal stress. At optimal temperature, the optic glands contribute importantly to regulating the energetic balance, as suggested by the expression of genes that modulate the metabolic rate, arterial blood pressure and the management of ATP sources in response to food deprivation. At elevated temperatures, the optic glands of mated females (before egg-laying) showed upregulation of genes encoding neuropeptides (FMRF-Amide, APGW-Amide, PRQFV-Amide, FCAP, buccalin and myomodulin) and the dopamine beta-hydroxylase gene. During egg-laying at elevated temperatures, the neuropeptide receptor capaR and the sex peptide receptor were upregulated whereas homologs of fetuin-B and oviduct-specific glycoprotein genes, crucial for fertilization, were downregulated. These changes in optic gland gene expression in O. maya may be the basis for the high-Temperature inhibition of egg-laying, previously observed from this octopus species. Furthermore, after egg-laying, during egg incubation thermal stress affected the expression of genes involved in steroid and thyroid hormone biosynthesis and in inflammatory and apoptotic pathways. © 2022 The Author(s).

abstract={Abalone is a marine gastropod mollusk that belongs to the genus Haliotis high-priced and with commercial importance worldwide. Because of its high demand, its products are susceptible to retail fraud by substituting lower-value products or protected species instead of higher-value ones. Therefore, species identification is a crucial traceability element, and restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) is a genomic tool that permits achieving this goal in non-model species with few developments in genetic data. This study analyzed five ecological and socio-economically important abalone species that inhabit the west coast and islands of the Baja California Peninsula (BCP), Mexico: green H. fulgens, pink H. corrugata, red H. rufescens, black H. cracherodii and threaded/pinto H. kamtschatkana abalones. The number of putative bi-allelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found across the five species was 150 326 loci. After filtering data, 1 127 SNPs (Total panel) were retained from 223 sequenced abalones. Subsequently, two criteria were used to identify the most informative SNPs markers: private alleles (species-specific) and FST outliers (adaptive markers). The reduced 66 Private SNPs allele panel performs similarly to the Total panel with a 100% correct assignment among the five species, whereas the 24 SNPs FST outlier panel could only correctly assign four out of five species, confusing the threaded/pinto and red abalones. Furthermore, both reduced panels successfully identify black abalone individuals, which has a commercial and conservation importance for seafood trade in Mexico. Therefore, all these markers can be used in seafood traceability and specimen identification in enforcing fishery management measures among these five abalone species. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Crassostrea virginica was exposed to different light crude oil levels to assess the effect on transcriptomic response and metabolic rate. The exposure time was 21 days, and levels of 100 and 200 μg/L were used, including a control. The most significant difference among treatments was the overexpression of several genes associated with energy production, reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation, immune system response, and inflammatory response. Also, a hydrocarbon concentration-related pattern was identified in ROS regulation, with a gene expression ratio near 1.8:1 between 200 and 100 μg/L treatments. Statistical analysis showed no interaction effect for metabolic rate; however, significant differences were found for oil concentration and time factors, with a higher oxygen consumption at 200 μg/L. Our findings provide novel information about the metabolic response of C. virginica during hydrocarbons exposure. In addition, our results point out which biological processes should be investigated as targets for searching bioindicators. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The optic glands (OG) of cephalopods are a source of molecules associated with the control of reproductive traits and lifecycle events such as sexual maturation, reproductive behavior, feeding, parental care, and senescence. However, little is known about the role of the optic gland in Octopus maya adults during mating and egg laying. RNA sequencing, de novo transcriptome assembly, ubiquity and differential expression analysis were performed. First, we analyzed the expression patterns of transcripts commonly associated with OG regulatory functions to describe their possible role once the maturation of the gonad is complete. The transcriptomic profiles of the optic gland of both sexes were compared with emphasis on the signaling pathways involved in the dimorphism of reproductive traits. Results suggest that in the OG of males, the reproductive condition (mated or non-mated) did not affect the general expression profile. In contrast, more differentially expressed genes were observed in females. In mated females, the mRNA metabolic process and the response to norepinephrine were enriched, suggesting a high cellular activity in preparation for the laying of the embryos. Whereas in egg-laying females, energetic and metabolic processes were the most represented, including the oxidation-reduction process. Finally, the gene expression patterns in senescence females suggest a physiological response to starvation as well as upregulation of genes involved retrotransposon activity. In conclusion, more substantial fluctuations in gene expression were observed in the optic glands of the fertilized females compared to the males. Such differences might be associated with the regulation of the egg-laying and the onset of senescence. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The SLC5/STAC histidine kinases comprise a recently identified family of sensor proteins in two-component signal transduction systems (TCSTS), in which the signaling domain is fused to an SLC5 solute symporter domain through a STAC domain. Only two members of this family have been characterized experimentally, the CrbS/R system that regulates acetate utilization in Vibrio and Pseudomonas, and the CbrA/B system that regulates the utilization of histidine in Pseudomonas and glucose in Azotobacter. In an attempt to expand the characterized members of this family beyond the Gammaproteobacteria, we identified two putative TCSTS in the Alphaproteobacterium Sinorhizobium fredii NGR234 whose sensor histidine kinases belong to the SLC5/STAC family. Using reverse genetics, we were able to identify the first TCSTS as a CrbS/R homolog that is also needed for growth on acetate, while the second TCSTS, RpuS/R, is a novel system required for optimal growth on pyruvate. Using RNAseq and transcriptional fusions, we determined that in S. fredii the RpuS/R system upregulates the expression of an operon coding for the pyruvate symporter MctP when pyruvate is the sole carbon source. In addition, we identified a conserved DNA sequence motif in the putative promoter region of the mctP operon that is essential for the RpuR-mediated transcriptional activation of genes under pyruvate-utilizing conditions. Finally, we show that S. fredii mutants lacking these TCSTS are affected in nodulation, producing fewer nodules than the parent strain and at a slower rate.

abstract={Background: Elevated temperatures reduce fertilization and egg-laying rates in the octopus species. However, the molecular mechanisms that control the onset of fertilization and egg-laying in the octopus’ oviducal gland are still unclear; and the effect of temperature on the expression of key reproductive genes is unknown. This study aims to better understand the molecular bases of octopus fertilization and egg-laying, and how they are affected by elevated temperatures. Method: RNA-seq of oviducal glands was performed for samples before, during, and after fertilization and their transcriptomic profiles were compared. Also, at the fertilization stage, the optimal and thermal-stress conditions were contrasted. Expression levels of key reproductive genes were validated via RT-qPCR. Results: In mated females before egg-laying, genes required for the synthesis of spermine, spermidine, which may prevent premature fertilization, and the myomodulin neuropeptide were upregulated. Among the genes with higher expression at the fertilization stage, we found those encoding the receptors of serotonin, dopamine, and progesterone; genes involved in the assembly and motility of the sperm flagellum; genes that participate in the interaction between male and female gametes; and genes associated with the synthesis of eggshell mucoproteins. At temperatures above the optimal range for reproduction, mated females reduced the fertilization rate. This response coincided with the upregulation of myomodulin and APGW-amide neuropeptides. Also, genes associated with fertilization like LGALS3, VWC2, and Pcsk1 were downregulated at elevated temperatures. Similarly, in senescent females, genes involved in fertilization were downregulated but those involved in the metabolism of steroid hormones like SRD5A1 were highly expressed.

abstract={The irradiance level used in the microalgae cultures can modify the growth and proximate composition; however, this response is specie specific. The dinoflagellate group has the potential to be used as a source of biofuel production. This study evaluated the effect of five irradiance levels (50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 µmol photon m−2 s−1) on the growth rate, proximal composition, pigment content, and photosynthesis of Amphidinium carterae. The highest cell concentration was for the cultures at 150 µmol photon m−2 s−1 (130 × 103 cells mL−1) and the lowest value for 50 µmol photon m−2 s−1 (49 × 103 cells mL−1). The cultures maintained under the lowest irradiance had the highest values of organic dry weight (ODW) and inorganic dry weight (IDW). The protein and carbohydrate content changes significantly concerning the irradiance level, with the higher values (1599.46 pg cell−1 and 557.24 pg cell−1, respectively) at an irradiance of 200 µmol photon m−2 s−1. Lipid content was modified by the effect of irradiance, with the highest values (6920.89 pg cell−1) at the lowest irradiance used. As a general trend, the high irradiances increased the photosynthesis rates. These findings demonstrate that the strain of A. carterae used in this work can grow in high irradiances (100 to 250 µmol photon m−2 s−1) and significantly increase the lipid content at low irradiance used. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

In Mexico, Baja California (B.C.) is the region with the highest production of V. vinifera L. grapes for industrial purposes. Recently, the diversity of viruses infecting insects only (insect-specific viruses) has been broadly explored to elucidate further ecological viral-host interactions in many insect species, which in some cases has resulted in the application of virus-based biological control agents for insect pests. However, a survey of the Pl. ficus virome has not been done yet. In the present study, we pooled Pl. ficus individuals collected through different vineyards of Ensenada, B.C., Mexico and analysed them by meta-transcriptomics. Novel nearly complete genomes of five RNA viruses were retrieved. These viruses were related to the Iflaviridae and Reoviridae families, and to the Picornavirales and Tolivirales orders. A new isolate belonging to the Dicistroviridae family was also found. Phylogenetic analyses showed that these putative viral genomes group with viruses having hemipteran (including a mealybug species) or other insect hosts, or with viruses associated with insects. Our results suggest that the identified novel RNA viruses could be insect-specific viruses of Pl. ficus. This work is the first insight into the Pl. ficus virome; it guarantees further studies aimed to characterize those viruses with potential for application in biological control of this economically important insect © 2022 Microbiology Society.

abstract={Zooplankton plays a pivotal role in sustaining the majority of marine ecosystems. The distribution patterns and diversity of zooplankton provide key information for understanding the functioning of these ecosystems. Nevertheless, due to the numerous cryptic and sibling species and the lack of diagnostic characteristics for early developmental stages, the identification of the global-to-local patterns of zooplankton biodiversity and biogeography remains challenging in different research fields. The spatial and temporal changes in the zooplankton community in the open waters of the southern Gulf of Mexico were assessed using metabarcoding analysis of the V9 region of 18S rRNA and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase c subunit I (COI). Additionally, a multiscale analysis was implemented to evaluate which environmental predictors may explain the variability in the structure of the zooplankton community. Our findings suggest that the synergistic effects of dissolved oxygen concentration, temperature, and longitude (intended as a proxy for still unidentified predictors) may explain both spatial and temporal zooplankton variability even with low contribution. Furthermore, the zooplankton distribution probably reflects the coexistence of three heterogeneous ecoregions and a bio-physical partitioning of the studied area. Finally, some taxa were either exclusive or predominant with either 18S or COI markers. This may suggest that comprehensive assessments of the zooplankton community may be more accurately met by the use of multilocus approaches. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Zooplankton is a key component in marine ecosystem health assessment. Here, we present a taxonomically comprehensive description of the zooplankton community (0-200 m) based on metabarcoding of the V9 hypervariable region of the 18S rRNA gene of 47 samples collected in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) during summer 2015. Fourteen phyla were identified Arthropoda were dominant, with Calanidae, Metridinidae, and Euphausiidae as the most conspicuous families. Other abundant phyla were Cnidaria (Hydrozoa), Chordata (Tunicata), and Chaetognatha. The V9-18S sequence data were clustered into 1888 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), of which 39 were cosmopolitan and belonging to various phyla, suggesting the presence of a core community with high local diversity throughout the GoM. Evaluation of metabarcoding sequences abundance showed overall positive correlations with morphologically quantified abundances except for specific groups. Cluster analysis of OTU distributions indicated two primary biographically distinctive groups of stations: one restricted to the Bay of Campeche, while the other occurred in the Central-West GoM, similar to previous descriptions of regional variation of the GoM based on environmental variables. Together these results provide a foundation for broad-scale zooplankton molecular biodiversity assessments in the southern GoM allowing evaluation of the effects of environmental changes on zooplankton communities. © 2021 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2021.

abstract={Background: Seriola lalandi is an important species for aquaculture, due to its rapid growth, adaptation to captivity and formulated diets, and high commercial value. Due to the rise in fishmeal (FM) price, efforts have been and still are made to replace it partially or entirely with vegetable meals in diets for carnivorous fish. The use of prebiotics when feeding vegetable meals has improved fish health. Methods: Four experimental diets were assessed in juveniles, the control diet consisted of FM as the main protein source, the second diet included 2% of GroBiotic®-A (FM-P), in the third diet FM was partially replaced (25%) by soybean meal (SM25), and the fourth consisted of SM25 with 2% of GroBiotic®-A (SM25-P). Growth was evaluated and RNA-seq of the liver tissue was performed, including differential expression analysis and functional annotation to identify genes affected by the diets. Results: Growth was not affected by this level of FM replacement, but it was improved by prebiotics. Annotation was achieved for 59,027 transcripts. Gene expression was affected by the factors: 225 transcripts due to FM replacement, 242 due to prebiotics inclusion, and 62 due to the interaction of factors. The SM25-P diet showed the least amount of differentially expressed genes against the control diet. Conclusion: The replacement of FM (25%) by soybean meal combined with prebiotics (2%) represents a good cost-benefit balance for S. lalandi juveniles since the fish growth increased and important metabolic and immune system genes in the liver were upregulated with this diet. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Since thermal stress enhances the energy demands, it is possible to hypothesize that the harmful effects of high temperatures observed in Octopus maya are the result of the limited capacity of adults to channel more energy that reproductive activity demands. The present study was designed to know how temperature modulates the energy physiology of O. maya adults. It was evaluated through the relationship between temperature, respiratory metabolism (measured as thermal metabolic scope: TMS), antioxidant defence mechanisms (ANTIOX) and oxidative damage indicators (ODI). Groups of males and females of O. maya were individually distributed at 24℃, 26℃ and 30℃. TMS resulted lower in animals acclimated to 30℃. Also, higher values of ANTIOX and ODI were registered in the branchial hearts in octopus acclimated to 30℃. Results demonstrate that 30℃ is a temperature that limits the energy production in O. maya, probably because of the incapacity of animals to transport oxygen to mitochondria. Although the animals are adapted to satisfy their basic energy requirements at 30℃, we hypothesize that it is not enough to cover all the energy demands needed for reproduction. At 30℃, joint with a reduction on physiologically available energy a high level of oxidative stress was observed, both explaining the previously reported reduction in the production of eggs, in the production of viable sperm and therefore in the quality of the progeny. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Ocean acidification generates a decrease in calcium carbonate availability essential for biomineralization in organisms such as mollusks. This effect was evaluated on Panopea globosa exposing for 7 days umbonate veliger larvae to two pH treatments: experimental (pH 7.5) and control (pH 8.0). Exposure to pH 7.5 affected growth, reducing larval shell length from 5.15–13.34% compared to the control group. This size reduction was confirmed with electron microscopy, also showing shell damage. The physiological response showed an increase in oxygen consumption in larvae exposed to low pH with a maximum difference of 1.57 nmol O2 h−1 larvae−1 at day 7. The gene expression analyses reported high expression values for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) dehydrogenase and Perlucin in larvae at pH 7.5, suggesting a higher energetic cost in this larval group to maintain homeostasis. In conclusion, this study showed that acidification affected development of P. globosa umbonate veliger larvae. © 2020},

abstract={Along the Pacific coast of the Baja California Peninsula (Mexico), abalone represents one of the most lucrative fisheries. As wild populations are currently depleted, abalone farm production aims to balance the decreasing populations with the increasing demand. The Mexican abalone aquaculture is almost entirely based on red abalone (Haliotis rufescens). However, the increasing frequency of extreme temperature events is hampering this activity. The use interspecific hybrids can potentially improve abalone culture, as species have differences in their thermal tolerance. Therefore, the hybrid progeny between H. rufescens (♀) and pink abalone H. corrugata (♂), a temperate and a warmer water abalone species, respectively, will naturally support higher temperature. To test this hypothesis, growth rate, mortality and metabolic rate of both pure (RR) and hybrid abalone (RP) were assessed under the H. rufescens’ optimum (18 °C) and thermally stressed (22 °C) conditions. To unveil the molecular pathways involved in the heat response, transcriptional profiling of both crosses was also investigated. At high temperature, we observed constrained growth and survival in RR while RP showed a significant increase in both rates, supporting the improved performance of the hybrid compared. These results match with the transcriptional profiling of hybrids showing higher expression of genes involved in growth and calcification, whereas in the pure red progeny, the transcriptional profile was mainly associated with the regulation of necroptosis process. Our results may contribute to propose new management plans to increase farm abalone production in Baja California. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Mesoscale features within the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) are known to influence zooplankton dynamics. Here we describe the composition of the zooplankton assemblage off shelf during summer in relation to environmental conditions, with emphasis on hyperiid amphipods and salps. Zooplankton samples were collected in summer of 2015 and 2016 in the central and southern GOM and in the Yucatan Channel in 2015. Two anticyclonic gyres were present in the north and less intense coupled cyclonic-anticyclonic gyres in the south. Zooplankton abundances differed temporally and spatially. Copepods were the dominant group (>55% of total abundance), while several less abundant taxa contributed to inter-annual and spatial differences. Amphipods and salps comprised <3% and their abundances were positively correlated. Fifty-six hyperiid and 10 salp species were identified. The dominant amphipod species were: Lestrigonus bengalensis (summer 2015), Anchylomera blossevillei and Primno spp. juveniles (summer 2016). Dominant salp species were Ihlea punctata, Iasis cylindrica and Thalia spp. Lower salp and amphipod species richness and abundance were associated with anticyclonic structures. Spatial and temporal differences were partly associated with symbiotic relationships between the groups.

Jointly, the effect of acclimation and critical temperatures on heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh-a) gene expressions were also analysed using acclimation temperatures of 20, 23, 26, 29 and 32°C. The results showed that the final preferred temperature in juvenile snapper was 26°C with a thermal window of 336.5°C2, which was related to an optimal temperature for their physiology determined by the routine metabolic rate and thermal metabolic scope. At temperatures from 20 to 26°C, the routine metabolic rate and Hsp70 and Ldh-a genes had the lowest values related to a basal expression level. At acclimation temperatures from 29 to 32°C and after critical thermal maximum (CTmax) limit, the relative expression of Hsp70 and Ldh-a genes increased significantly, but the main response at CTmax was the upregulation of Hsp70 gene. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={The greatest threat scleractinian corals face today is accelerated climate change. Assuming that most scleractinians are incapable of genetic adaptation to rapid global changes, the alternative response would be phenotypic plasticity, which is classically described as accli-matization. With the purpose of establishing a baseline for the study of acclimatization in corals of the Pacific coast of Mexico, we assessed the molecular and physiological response of 36 colonies of 3 Pocillopora morphospecies (Pocillopora cf. capitata, Pocillopora cf. damicornis, and Pocillopora cf. verrucosa) located at 2 sites (east and west) on Carrizales Reef. Our results show higher incidence of light and chlorophyll concentrations in seawater samples from the west side, suggesting the presence of at least 2 microenvironments with more and less light in the reef. In response, coral morphospecies from the west side showed higher gene expression and significant differences in pigment concentra-tions, endosymbiont densities, and metabolic markers (RNA, DNA, and proteins). Given the present concern about the future of coral reefs, we consider that the present study could be used as a baseline for the study of the physiological and molecular plasticity of Pocillopora corals in Mexican waters, so conservation strategies could be developed for key morphospecies in coral reefs on the Pacific coast of Mexico. © 2020, Universidad Autonoma de Baja California.

abstract={The adverse effect of crude oil on marine invertebrates is well known. To have a better understanding of its effects on marine invertebrates, Crassostrea virginica was exposed to different concentrations (50, 100 and 200 μg/L) of a mixture of super-light and light crude oil for two weeks, evaluating the transcriptomic response of the digestive gland using RNA-Seq and their accumulation in soft tissues. A total of 33,469,374 reads were assembled, which resulted in 61,356 genome assemblies (‘Genes’). Trinotate was used for transcript annotation. At the end of this process, 86,409 transcripts were maintained, comprising a broad set of enzymes from xenobiotics metabolism, oxidative stress, stress and immune responses, and energetic metabolism. The enrichment analysis revealed a change in biological processes and molecular functions, finding from 100 to 200 μg/L. Moreover, the differential gene expression analysis showed a dose-dependent transcriptional response, generally up to 100 μg/L and in some cases up to 200 μg/L, which suggested that oysters' response decreased after 100 μg/L; the analysis of crude oil presence in soft tissues indicated that C. virginica is a suitable candidate for ecotoxicology. Finally, these results should contribute to expanding current genomic resources for C. virginica. Furthermore, they will help to develop new studies in aquatic toxicology focused on knowledge in depth of metabolic pathways, jointly with other approaches (such as proteomics) to allow obtaining a complete idea about the eastern oyster response to crude oil. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

Its optimal growth was at 15% NaCl even though it was able to grow at 25% and is incapable of growth with no NaCl. Based on its morphological characteristics as conidia chain production in a single phialide, the fungal is related to the genus Aspergillus, subgenus Polypaecilum. Phylogenetic molecular analysis using several markers (ITS1–2; RPB1; RPB2; Cct8; TSR1; CaM; BenA) places the fungal isolate closer to Aspergillus salinarus and A. baarnensis. However, its morphological and molecular differences establish it as a new species, Aspergillus loretoensis sp. nov. © 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={White bodies (WB), multilobulated soft tissue that wraps the optic tracts and optic lobes, have been considered the hematopoietic organ of the cephalopods. Its glandular appearance and its lobular morphology suggest that different parts of the WB may perform different functions, but a detailed functional analysis of the octopus WB is lacking. The aim of this study is to describe the transcriptomic profile of WB to better understand its functions, with emphasis on the difference between sexes during reproductive events. Then, validation via qPCR was performed using different tissues to find out tissue-specific transcripts. High differentiation in signaling pathways was observed in the comparison of female and male transcriptomic profiles. For instance, the expression of genes involved in the androgen receptor-signaling pathway were detected only in males, whereas estrogen receptor showed higher expression in females. Highly expressed genes in males enriched oxidation-reduction and apoptotic processes, which are related to the immune response. On the other hand, expression of genes involved in replicative senescence and the response to cortisol were only detected in females. Moreover, the transcripts with higher expression in females enriched a wide variety of signaling pathways mediated by molecules like neuropeptides, integrins, MAPKs and receptors like TNF and Toll-like. In addition, these putative neuropeptide transcripts, showed higher expression in females’ WB and were not detected in other analyzed tissues. These results suggest that the differentiation in signaling pathways in white bodies of O. maya influences the physiological dimorphism between females and males during the reproductive phase. © 2019 Juárez et al.

abstract={Accurate identification of fish larval stages is complicated and time-consuming due to the lack of diagnostic morphological characters, especially during early developmental stages. The distribution of lanternfish (Myctophidae) has been described based on the morphological identification of adult stages. Larvae of only a few species of Myctophidae have been described, and the description is not always precise. In this study, larvae were collected and morphologically identified as Diaphus mollis, Hygophum hygomii, H. reinhardtii, H. taaningi, Myctophum obtusirostre and M. selenops. The DNA barcode region of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI) was determined for all larvae. The COI sequences matched reference barcodes available in GenBank for 14 of the identified larvae. The remaining COI sequences matched reference barcodes for different species of Myctophidae including Centrobranchus nigroocellatus, Diogenichthys atlanticus and Lepidophanes guentheri. This effort demonstrated the importance of integrated morphological and molecular analysis of species diversity and distribution of the Myctophidae in the Gulf of México. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The Crassostrea virginica oyster has biological and economic importance in the Gulf of Mexico, an area with a high extraction and production of hydrocarbons. Exposure to hydrocarbons affects the reproductive processes in bivalves. In C. virginica, the effect of hydrocarbons on the gonad of the undifferentiated organism has not been evaluated to determine the possible damage during the maturation process. To evaluate this effect, RNA-seq data was generated from C. virginica gonads exposed to a 200 μg/L of hydrocarbons at different exposure times (7, 14 and 21 days) and a control treatment (without hydrocarbons). The analysis of the gonad transcriptome showed the negative effect of hydrocarbons on maturation, with a sub-expression of 22 genes involved in different stages of this process. Additionally, genes in the immune system were down-regulated, which may indicate that exposure to hydrocarbons causes immunosuppression in bivalves. A group of oxidative stress genes was also reduced. These data contribute to a better understanding of the effect of hydrocarbons on the reproductive process in bivalves and, at the same time, allow us to identify possible biomarkers associated with hydrocarbon contamination in the gonad of C. virginica. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Octopus maya endemic to the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, is an ectotherm organism particularly temperature-sensitive. Studies in O. maya females show that temperatures above 27◦C reduce the number of eggs per spawn, fertilization rate and the viability of embryos. High temperatures also reduce the male reproductive performance and success. However, the molecular mechanisms are still unknown. The transcriptomic profiles of testes from thermally stressed (30◦C) and not stressed (24◦C) adult male octopuses were compared, before and after mating to understand the molecular bases involved in the low reproductive performance at high temperature. The testis paired-end cDNA libraries were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Then, the transcriptome was assembled de novo using Trinity software. A total of 53,214,611 high-quality paired reads were used to reconstruct 85,249 transcripts and 77,661 unigenes with an N50 of 889 bp length. Later, 13,154 transcripts were annotated implementing Blastx searches in the UniProt database. Differential expression analysis revealed 1,881 transcripts with significant difference among treatments. Functional annotation and pathway mapping of differential expressed transcripts revealed significant enrichment for biological processes involved in spermatogenesis, gamete generation, germ cell development, spermatid development and differentiation, response to stress, inflammatory response and apoptosis. Remarkably, the transcripts encoding genes such as ZMYND15, KLHL10, TDRD1, TSSK2 and DNAJB13, which are linked to male infertility in other species, were differentially expressed among the treatments. The expression levels of these key genes, involved in sperm motility and spermatogenesis were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. The results suggest that the reduction in male fertility at high temperature can be related to alterations in spermatozoa development and motility.

abstract={Observations of wild male O. maya suggest that temperatures below 27 °C favour their reproductive performance. From these observations we hypothesize that, as in females, the temperature modulates the reproductive performance of adult O. maya males. The study aimed to evaluate the physiological condition, reproductive success, and histological damage in testis of male O. maya exposed to thermal stress, to determine the implications of ocean warming over their reproductive performance. High temperatures (28–30 °C) negatively affect the growth and health of male O. maya. In octopuses maintained at 30 °C, as a consequence of the thermal stress we observed an increment in the haemocytes number, a reduction in the oxygen consumption rate, and an inflammatory process in the testis. The number of spermatozoa per spermatophore was not affected by temperature, but higher spermatophores production was observed at 30 °C. The paternity analysis showed that the offspring had multiple paternity with an average of 10 males contributing in a single spawn. The paternal contribution was affected by temperature with high, medium, or no paternal contribution in animals maintained at 24 °C (control group), 28 °C and 30 °C, respectively. The temperatures from 28 °C to 30 °C deeply affected the reproductive performance of Octopus maya males, suggesting that, as embryos, reproductive performance of adult males of this octopus species can be used as a tool for monitoring thermal changes in Yucatán Peninsula, located at the entrance of Gulf of Mexico. © 2018},

abstract={Spirolides are polyether cyclic imines considered as "fast acting toxins." Long-term human health consequences of spirolide ingestion are uncertain, and hence regulatory limits for human consumption have not been established. Nevertheless, monitoring these toxins in shellfish is essential because they can interfere with detection by mouse bioassay of lipophilic regulated toxins. Todos Santos Bay (TSB), in the northwest of the Baja California Peninsula, is an important shellfish cultivation and fish-farming area in Mexico. The toxin analog 13-desmethyl spirolide C has been reported in cultivated mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) from TSB, but the causative species associated with accumulation of this toxin has not been previously identified. We assessed the occurrence of Alexandrium ostenfeldii, the unique known producer of spirolides, by inverted light microscopy and by PCR with species-specific oligonucleotides designed for the ITS and 18S rDNA. We determined the presence and abundance of this species at the surface and at the thermocline from samples collected over two annual sampling periods (2013-2014 and 2016-2017). During the 2013-2014 period, A. ostenfeldii was found in 50% of the samples analyzed by light microscopy. The highest cell abundance (about 3.6 × 103 cells L-1) occurred in October 2013. During 2016-2017 the dinoflagellate was present in low cell abundances ( &lt; 5 × 102 cells L-1) and was detected in only 20.9% of the samples. Cells of this species were usually found when sea surface temperature ranged from 17 to 20°C. We also evaluated spirolide accumulated in cultivated mussels from TSB by tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The only spirolide detected was 13-desmethyl spirolide C, found mainly during the 2013-2014 sampling period, with the highest concentration (1.05 μg kg-1) in June 2014. During winter, toxin concentration was at or below the detection limit. During 2016-2017, spirolides were below the detection limit, coinciding with the absence of the causative species. Cell abundance of A. ostenfeldii and spirolide concentration in mussels did not present a clear correlation. This study represents the first record of A. ostenfeldii in TSB and provides evidence that this species is the primary origin of spirolides accumulated in mussels. © 2018 Paredes-Banda, García-Mendoza, Ponce-Rivas, Blanco, Almazán-Becerril, Galindo-Sánchez and Cembella.},

abstract={The Cortes geoduck Panopea globosa is a large bivalve with a high commercial value distributed from the southern Pacific coast of the Baja California Peninsula to the northern Gulf of California, inhabiting a wide range of subtropical temperatures. A new record of this species in shallower waters suggests that it can tolerate a warmer environment than previously thought. To better understand the whole-body and molecular response mechanisms to different temperatures, we assessed the metabolic rate of juvenile individuals exposed to chronic and acute thermal conditions and analyzed the transcriptomic response in ctenidial tissues. Whole-body metabolic rate measurements showed that juveniles were able to acclimate at least partially within three weeks from 20 °C (C20) to 29 °C (C29), while organisms acutely exposed to 29 °C (A29) significantly increased their metabolic rate. This was coincident with transcriptomic results, as similar gene expression patterns were found in clams chronically exposed to C29 and C20, but different from those acutely exposed to 29 °C (A29) and 31 °C (A31). High degree of expression of genes involved in DNA repair and transcription regulation were found in C29 juveniles, whereas protective genes against oxidative stress were highly expressed in A29 organisms. A high expression of genes involved in protein re-folding was also observed in A31 juveniles. In conclusion, the combined results of whole-body metabolism and transcriptomic expression patterns suggest that P. globosa juveniles have a high physiological plasticity and are well adapted to inhabit an environment with broad temperature fluctuations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Gut microbiota plays a determining role in the health status of the host. In general, a beneficial bacterial community, associated with a greater metabolic capacity and wellbeing, shows high values of species richness and relative abundance. Because environmental temperature is a regulating factor in fish physiological and metabolic processes, it is very important to understand the effect of environmental temperature on diversity and richness of gut microbiota in poikilothermic organisms. This study analysed the reciprocal diet-temperature correlations in the faecal microbiota diversity in Seriola lalandi. Juveniles were acclimated at 20 °C and 26 °C for 30 days; in addition, the fish were fed three diets with three levels of lipid inclusion (7%, 14% and 21%). Faecal microbiota in S. lalandi was characterized using the high-throughput sequencing approach based on the V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The most abundant phyla identified in this study were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. A significant change was observed in faecal microbiota in relation to acclimation temperature. The results indicated that species richness was modified in relation to the environmental temperatures; the Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) identified in fish acclimated at 26 °C belonged to the families Pseudomonadacea, Alcaligenaceae and Microbacteriaceae whereas those identified at 20 °C were Micavibrio, Comamonadaceae and Saprospiraceae. Furthermore, significant differences were observed between the OTUs identified in the dietary treatments, in which Actinobacteria (7% lipid), Gammaproteobacteria (14% lipid), Betaproteobacteria (21% lipid), and Flavobacteria (skretting diet) were the phyla preferentially identified from each treatment. The results obtained in this study demonstrated the importance of environmental temperature to maintain a balance in intestinal microbiota, as well as the effects of diet composition on proliferation of different microbial groups with respect to thermal induction. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The Octopus maya fishery is one of the most important among the octopod fisheries in America. Recent studies about the wild population of this species, have contributed to understand that population variations and dynamics are highly influenced by temperature. The distribution area of this species could be divided in two well-differentiated thermal zones: an eastern zone influenced by the upwelling pulses, and a western zone with no upwelling influence. There is evidence suggesting that variations in population parameters could be linked to these thermal zones. However the fishery is still managed as one single unit, and there is no control of the capture limit. In this study we analyzed the multilocus microsatellite genotypes of wild O. maya across its distribution area to find out if the population is structured, and if the structure matches the mentioned thermal zones. Additionally, the heterozygosity was compared between samples from 2010 and 2015 to monitor changes related to the high fishing pressure. Results show that O. maya population is structured in two clusters that match with the different thermal zones in the distribution area. Moreover, significant genic differentiation was detected between these thermal zones. On the other hand, despite the high fishing pressure over this species, there is no significant difference in heterozygosity between 2010 and 2015 samples, and no inbreeding was detected, showing that genetic diversity is still high. We recommend the continuous monitoring of heterozygosity in this species, and a separate fishery management for Campeche (western) and Yucatan (eastern) subpopulations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Saxitoxin (STX) and its analogs are a broad group of natural neurotoxic alkaloids, commonly known as paralytic shellfish toxins. SxtA is the initial gene in the biosynthesis of saxitoxin. It has been proposed that the genes for STX biosynthesis had a bacterial origin and were acquired in the dinoflagellates by a horizontal gene transfer (HGT). In Gymnodinium catenatum, the origin of the STX genes is not well established. In this paper, we sequenced sxtA gene (domains sxtA1 and sxtA4) and determined the gene copy number in the genome in four Mexican strains of G. catenatum. We compare them with sequences of G. catenatum, Pyrodinium bahamense, and Alexandrium spp. from other geographic regions, and non-toxic producing dinoflagellates. Amplifications were performed for domains sxtA1 and sxtA4 from strains of G. catenatum and the phylogenetic analyses was done by maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. The copy number determination was carried out using qPCR. The phylogenetic tree of domain sxtA4 showed the formation of two clades where G. catenatum sequences separated from the Alexandrium/Pyrodinium clade. The domain sxtA1 formed a higher number of clades than sxtA4. Sequences of G. catenatum were grouped together with sequences of Alexandrium. Dinoflagellates sequences that do not produce saxitoxin formed a separate clade. The gene copy number was 64 ± 30 and 110 ± 50 copies of sxtA1 and sxtA4 respectively. The identification of the gene sxtA of G. catenatum shows that the sequences are similar to those of Alexandrium species with low variations between species. These results may indicate that the acquisition of the gene sxtA was an early HGT event in the evolution of dinoflagellates. The possible loss of the ability to produce STX in some species suggests that the HGT from Alexandrium species toward G. catenatum is not possible. © 2018 Mendoza-Flores, Leyva-Valencia, Band-Schmidt, Galindo-Sánchez and Bustillos-Guzmán.},

abstract={The increased use of massive sequencing technologies has enabled the identification of several genes known to be involved in different mechanisms associated with reproduction that so far have only been studied in vertebrates and other model invertebrate species. In order to further investigate the genes involved in Litopenaeus vannamei reproduction, cDNA and SSH libraries derived from female eyestalk and gonad were produced, allowing the identification of expressed sequences tags (ESTs) that potentially have a role in the regulation of gonadal maturation. In the present study, different transcripts involved in reproduction were identified and a number of them were characterized as full-length. These transcripts were evaluated in males and females in order to establish their tissue expression profiles during developmental stages (juvenile, subadult and adult), and in the case of females, their possible association with gonad maturation was assessed through expression analysis of vitellogenin. The results indicated that the expression of vitellogenin receptor (vtgr) and minichromosome maintenance (mcm) family members in the female gonad suggest an important role during previtellogenesis. Additionally, the expression profiles of genes such as famet, igfbp and gpcr in brain tissues suggest an interaction between the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway (IIS) and methyl farnesoate (MF) biosynthesis for control of reproduction. Furthermore, the specific expression pattern of farnesoic acid O-methyltransferase suggests that final synthesis of MF is carried out in different target tissues, where it is regulated by esterase enzymes under a tissue-specific hormonal control. Finally, the presence of a vertebrate type steroid receptor in hepatopancreas and intestine besides being highly expressed in female gonads, suggest a role of that receptor during sexual maturation. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Populations of the black sea urchin Arbacia stellata present in the Gulf of California and outer Pacific Coast area are probably the result of colonization from the Panamic region. In the Pacific Coast of Baja California, this species experiences seasonal fluctuations of temperature. It was determined the preferred temperature (PT), critical threshold limits represented for Critical Thermal Maximum (CTMax) and oxygen consumption rate in organisms acclimated to 16°C, 19°C, 22°C, and 25°C in controlled conditions. The PT of A. stellata was determined in organisms using the acute method. As the acclimation temperature increases, the PT also increases significantly (P < 0.05) and decreases to 22.8°C. In the acclimation temperature of 25°C, PT for black sea urchins was 23.3°C ± 0.3°C. A direct relation was determined between the CTMax and acclimation temperatures being of 36.48°C ± 0.6°C, 37.64°C ± 0.76°C, 38.08°C ± 0.94°C, 38.42°C ± 0.71°C. The end point of CTMax was stage E4, where the sea urchins stop moving, relax the large spines but activity continues with light movements of small spines and when the organisms lose the ability to remain attached to the substrate. The oxygen consumption rates increased significantly (P < 0.05) from 5.59 to 11.5 mg O2 kg/h wet weight (w.w.) as the acclimation temperature increased from 16°C to 25°C. The range of temperature coefficient (Q10) between 16°C and 25°C (lowest) was 1.90, indicating that within that range of acclimation temperature, organisms are adapted to maintain homeostasis. This corresponded with the interval of PT of the species. These results may partially explain their distribution pattern in Baja California Coast. © 2018 National Shellfisheries Association.

abstract={Most of our understanding on embryonic development in cephalopods comes from studies using constant temperature. Even though spawning generally occurs at relatively stable environments, eggs and embryos can be exposed over short periods of time to high temperature anomalies caused by oceanic warming. Therefore, in this study we examined the effects of increasing temperatures on growth, respiratory metabolism, and antioxidant defense mechanisms to define the thermal limits of Octopus maya embryos in a changing environment. Ramp temperatures consisted in increments of 1 °C every 5 days from 24 °C to 30 °C. The thermal limit of embryos at ramp temperatures was detected at 27 °C with metabolic rate increments between 63% and 69%, compared with the metabolic rate observed at control temperature (24 °C). Based on the calculated integrated biomarker response (IBR) was possible to detect that at the thermal limit, an increment on oxygen consumption was observed joint with reactive oxygen species (ROS). The IBR analysis indicated that above 27 °C embryos experienced changes in the oxidative system and were not able to recover. This study suggests that in a scenario of rapidly increasing temperatures after a short winter, O. maya embryos may suffer irreversible effects that are likely to negatively affect recruitment and the population dynamic. The thermal sensitivity of O. maya embryos, revealed in the present work, indicates that this species has an important potential for biomonitoring of the effects of environmental warming. Changes in the population dynamics of this species should be further studied since they can be used as a proxy for warming of the southern Gulf of Mexico ecosystems. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this study we evaluated physiological, metabolic and hematological responses for the crab Cancer antennarius to different copper sulfate concentrations (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 mg L-1). The evaluated responses were: the median lethal dose, osmoregulatory capacity, oxygen consumption, ammonium excretion, atomic relation O:N, glucose, THC and hemocyanin concentration. The median lethal dose (LD50) we found was 1.6 mg L-1 of copper sulfate. The pattern followed on most of the observed responses was an increase directly proportional to the amount of copper sulfate concentration, except for osmoregulatory capacity where the osmoregulation pattern, usually isosmotic in normal conditions, was modified to hyposmotic. In the atomic relation O:N we observed a decrease in values due to changes in metabolic substrate as a result of stress caused by exposure to copper sulfate. © 2016, Universidad de Valparaiso.

abstract={Lasiodiplodia theobromae is a highly virulent plant pathogen. It has been suggested that heat stress increases its virulence. The aim of this work was to evaluate, compare, and recommend normalization strategies for gene expression analysis of the fungus growing with grapevine wood under heat stress. Using RT-qPCR-derived data, reference gene stability was evaluated through geNorm, NormFinder and Bestkeeper applications. Based on the geometric mean using the ranking position obtained for each independent analysis, genes were ranked from least to most stable as follows: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), actin (ACT), β-tubulin (TUB) and elongation factor-1α (EF1α). Using RNAseq-derived data based on the calculated tagwise dispersion these genes were ordered by increasing stability as follows: GAPDH, ACT, TUB, and EF1α. The correlation between RNAseq and RTqPCR results was used as criteria to identify the best RT-qPCR normalization approach. The gene TUB is recommended as the best option for normalization among the commonly used reference genes, but alternative fungal reference genes are also suggested. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Lasiodiplodia theobromae is a fungus of the Botryosphaeriaceae that causes grapevine vascular disease, especially in regions with hot climates. Fungi in this group often remain latent within their host and become virulent under abiotic stress. Transcriptional regulation analysis of L. theobromae exposed to heat stress (HS) was first carried out in vitro in the presence of grapevine wood (GW) to identify potential pathogenicity genes that were later evaluated for in planta expression. Results: A total of 19,860 de novo assembled transcripts were obtained, forty-nine per cent of which showed homology to the Botryosphaeriaceae fungi, Neofusicoccum parvum or Macrophomina phaseolina. Three hundred ninety-nine have homology with genes involved in pathogenic processes and several belonged to expanded gene families in others fungal grapevine vascular pathogens. Gene expression analysis showed changes in fungal metabolism of phenolic compounds; where genes encoding for enzymes, with the ability to degrade salicylic acid (SA) and plant phenylpropanoid precursors, were up-regulated during in vitro HS response, in the presence of GW. These results suggest that the fungal L-tyrosine catabolism pathway could help the fungus to remove phenylpropanoid precursors thereby evading the host defense response. The in planta up-regulation of salicylate hydroxylase, intradiol ring cleavage dioxygenase and fumarylacetoacetase encoding genes, further supported this hypothesis. Those genes were even more up-regulated in HS-stressed plants, suggesting that fungus takes advantage of the increased phenylpropanoid precursors produced under stress. Pectate lyase was up-regulated while a putative amylase was down-regulated in planta, this could be associated with an intercellular growth strategy during the first stages of colonization. Conclusions: L. theobromae transcriptome was established and validated. Its usefulness was demonstrated through the identification of genes expressed during the infection process. Our results support the hypothesis that heat stress facilitates fungal colonization, because of the fungus ability to use the phenylpropanoid precursors and SA, both compounds known to control host defense. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={Octopus maya supports an important fishery in Yucatan Peninsula (YP) where this species is highly abundant. Considering that temperatures in the tropics are increasing (IPCC, 2013), there are several scenarios that can modify the dynamic of the O. maya population in YP: i) prolonged summer and short winter seasons, and/or ii) fast temperature increases and high temperatures after a winter season, both affecting the survival of hatchlings and the performance of juveniles. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of maternal temperature stress over hatchling and juvenile performance in terms of their energetic plasticity and thermoregulatory behaviour, when they were exposed to a gradual temperature increase (TI) from 24 to 30. °C and compared with hatchlings maintained at preferred and constant temperature (24. °C). Hatchlings from stressed females were smaller, and had a lower growth rate compared to those from unstressed females providing evidence that temperature stress experienced by females has consequences on the performance of hatchlings, with effects on the biomass production and survival. Results also demonstrated that hatchlings exposed to TI (24-30. °C) had a growth rate and oxygen consumption similar to those maintained at preferred temperature (24. °C), in both female groups indicating that a gradual temperature increase of 1. °C every 5. days is probably enough to allow the organisms to make physiological adjustments without an excessive energetic cost. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Temperature is a key factor that modulates Octopus maya reproduction. Evidence shows that wild females spawn when ambient natural temperatures are lower than 26. °C, caused by either the winter sea temperatures or the upwelling events. The upwelling determines the availability of cold and nutrient rich water during spring and summer in the northern side of the Yucatán Peninsula (YP). We determined the effects of ambient temperature on the reproductive performance of female O. maya maintained in thermal regimes that simulate (a) high summer temperature at the eastern side of the YP (31. °C), (b) winter temperature in all the YP (24. °C), and (c) a temperature decrease (TD) at a rate of 1. °C/5d from 31 to 24. °C. The number of spawns, eggs spawned by female, fertilization percentage, embryos development, and hatchlings survival after starvation were evaluated for each thermal regime. At 31. °C spawning of O. maya females is inhibited; only 13% spawned. The few fertilized eggs spawned died after two 2. weeks, indicating that high temperatures are deleterious to embryos. Females exposed to temperature changes of 1. °C/5 d spawned only after temperature reached below 27. °C, 87% of the females spawned. At the end TD treatment a mean value of 530 eggs per spawn was observed. Fertilization of spawns was around 50%. All the females maintained at 24. °C spawned a mean of 1208 eggs/spawn with a 70.5% fertilization rate. Embryonic development was interrupted early in TD treatments causing premature hatchlings by day 31. These premature juveniles showed smaller sizes and low survival (48%) after a 10-day fast. In contrast, embryos spawned at 24. °C exhibited larger development (45d), and hatchlings survival after a 10-day fast was 100%. Our results explain why O. maya spawns are limited to winter in the western side of the YP, when temperatures drop due to polar winds. Results also highlight the importance of the Yucatan upwelling for maintaining suitable conditions for spawning, embryo development, and hatchling survival along the year at Eastern border of the YP. We consider that this species could be negatively affected if climate change leads to an ocean warming scenario. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The hermaphrodite Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas displays a high energy allocation to reproduction. We studied the expression of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) during gametogenesis in the gonad and characterized the mRNA sequences of the AMPK subunits: the AMPK alpha mRNA sequence was previously characterized; we identified AMPK beta, AMPK gamma, and mRNAs of putative AMPK-related targets following bioinformatics mining on existing genomic resources. We analyzed the mRNA expression of the AMPK alpha, beta, and gamma subunits in the gonads of male and female oysters through a reproductive cycle, and we quantified the mRNA expression of genes belonging to fatty acid and glucose metabolism. AMPK alpha mRNA levels were more abundant in males at the first stage of gametogenesis, when mitotic activity and the differentiation of germinal cells occur, and were always more abundant in males than in females. Some targets of fatty acid and glucose metabolism appeared to be correlated with the expression of AMPK subunits at the mRNA level. We then analyzed the sex-specific AMPK activity by measuring the phosphorylation of the catalytic AMPK alpha protein and its expression at the protein level. Both the amount of AMPK alpha protein and threonine 172 phosphorylation appeared to be almost totally inhibited in mature female gonads at stage 3, at the time when accumulation of reserves in oocytes was promoted, while it remained at a high level in mature spermatozoa.

abstract={Abalone species are different from most mollusks utilized in aquaculture as they are known to hybridize in laboratory-induced matings. Allotriploidization of hybrid abalone has not yet been studied, and methodology useful in verifying the genotypic condition of such allotriploids do not exist. Genotypic verification of hybridization and allotriploidization in a cross of Haliotis fulgens and Haliotis rufescens was performed utilizing 6 crossamplifying microsatellite loci. Five H. rufescens spawns were used in this experiment, dividing each spawn into control and experimental hybrid groups and further into diploids and triploids. Two microsatellite loci developed for H. fulgens and H. rufescens allowed for the genotypic identification of hybrids within diploid and triploids. To further verify the percentage of allotriploids within the genotypic hybrids in the triploid hybrid groups, microsatellite loci originally developed in Haliotis corrugata and Haliotis kamtschatkana were tested for crossamplification in H. fulgens and H. rufescens. Of 21 loci, 4 were chosen for this study based on their crossamplification, heterozygosity in the females, and centromere recombination frequencies. Allotriploids in triploid-hybrid larvae were then detected by identifying larvae with recombinant genotypes at any of those loci. One family had low success verification associated with reduced recombination frequencies for all loci in that family. These results demonstrate that allotriploid verification at larval stages is feasible but depends on the number of loci available, their crossamplification in the species, and their recombination frequencies. © The American Genetic Association. 2010.

abstract={Genetic variation in eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) collected from 13 sites in the Gulf of Mexico was examined using a combination of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing, mtDNA restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, and nuclear single nucleotide polymorphism analysis. Both mitochondrial and nuclear markers showed significant differentiation among samples. Combined with previous allozyme and microsatellite data, these results indicate considerable population subdivision throughout the Gulf of Mexico, despite the potentially homogenizing effect of larval dispersal.},

abstract={Genetic variation was evaluated in populations of the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin) from the coast of Veracruz, eastern Gulf of Mexico. We sampled six lagoons and analyzed variation at five microsatellite loci. Significant Hardy-Weinberg deviations occurred at all loci and were attributed to the presence of null alleles. We found no isolation by distance among the populations in these lagoons, but significant heterogeneity was observed among some adjacent lagoons, possibly reflections of geographical factors and local reductions in population size. Certain extreme north and south localities were not genetically different in terms of nonsignificant pairwise FST values. Gene flow is attributed to seasonal shifts in coastal currents, larval production throughout the year, human interference with the natural lagoon processes, and restocking efforts. The observed pattern of variation could be another example of chaotic genetic patchiness in marine organisms.},

abstract={Microsatellite loci were isolated in Haliotis fulgens using a (CT) n enriched-genomic library. From 33 sequenced clones, 21 microsatellites regions were identified, 15 with the expected (CT)n. Eight microsatellite loci were amplified, six of which were polymorphic with a range of three to 20 alleles, and five cross-amplified in two other species (Haliotis rufescens and Haliotis corrugata). These microsatellites will be useful as population genetic markers in the three species. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Nine microsatellite loci were isolated and characterized from California sea lions (Zalophus californianus). In addition, two of five loci tested from harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) produced a single, clear band in Z. californianus, as did one out of five loci from grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) and one out of two loci from elephant seal (Mirounga sp.). No locus tested from South American fur seal (Arctocephalus australis) amplified in Z. californianus. Locus variability was assessed in California sea lions from Los Islotes rookery, Baja California Sur, Mexico. All loci were variable, with allele numbers ranging from three to 12. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},
